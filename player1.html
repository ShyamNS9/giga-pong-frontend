            ==============
            Think of this as a blank piece of paper
            Our JavaScript code will draw the game on this
            - Width and height are set in JavaScript from config
            - The 'id' lets JavaScript find this element
            - Wrapped in a container for responsive scaling

        Order matters! Config must load first, then game.js

        START THE GAME
        ==============
        This inline script runs when the page loads
        It calls the startGame function from game.js with 'player1'
    -->

        // When the page loads, start the game as player1
